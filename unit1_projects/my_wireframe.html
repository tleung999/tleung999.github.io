		<h1>My new web page plan</h1>
		<p>So after reading up about responsive design, proper web design, and user experience.   I plan to implement these techniques into my new page.   Also working with HTML5, I plan on limiting my usage of divs and building my site semantically better.  Playing around with fonts types and icon fonts, I plan to use more of these to improve my performance and allow faster load times of my pages.    Lastly I will use tools such as Color Scheme Designer 3 to start my site off with a good color palette.
		</p>
		<p>The site again will be a blog site that will incorporate all the dbc blogs I write.  But I hope this time it will work for a variety of screens/devices.   Listed below is the old wireframe of my site and also what my new wireframe will look like now.
