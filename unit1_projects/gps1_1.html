        <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
        <img src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pair-programming.jpg?w=400"/>
        <p>Pair programming is a beneficial method of working together and sharing knowledge. 
        You help each other work through a problem using a driver and navigator setup. For example, 
        having a person that knows Python well while another programmer only knows PHP.   Throughout the 
        pairing session, the knowledge of each party can get transfered over.   By pair programming both parties involved can
        learn something off each other.  Pair programming also holds each individual accountable.  Two heads are better than 
        one, and if you constantly bounce ideas off each other, you can end up with richer ideas and more elegant solutions.

        <h2>Driver & Navigator relationship</h2>

        <h4>What is a Driver?</h4>
        <p>
          A driver is the person that will conduct all the actual coding and making sure the syntax is correct.
        </p>
        <h4>What is a Navigator?</h4>
        <p>
          A Navigator is the person that takes a higher level and helps the driver "navigate" through the problem.   He
          would be the person that looks at the wireframe, design layout, or psuedo code and helps direct the driver on how to
          write the code.

        <h2>Reflect with your pair</h2>

          My first pairing session was a little off since I didnt actually have another student pair with me.  But in the end it was great since my instructor was my pair.   He basically took the navigation seat and I was the driver.   I enjoy it a lot since we really talked out the process together.  I started the initial wireframe and showed it to him to see if there was anything he would like adjusted. After we agreed on the initial layout, I started building out the basic HTML5 structure.   Once the top down structure was built, we went back over the layout and revise any tags we felt was not correct.  When we we're finally both happy with the structure, we had to break off and finish the rest on our own.   But before we closed out the session, we did a quick talk over what type of CSS changes we would like to see and how to implement it.

          I really enjoyed working with my pair and teaming up to solve a problem.   If I got stuck, he was there to give me a little nudge with his idea.   During the pairing session, I also actively asked for his feeling about certain elements I put in to make sure he also likes the direction I am going.   Everything seems to workout really well.   I have no complaints.
