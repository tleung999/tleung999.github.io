			<h3>Exploring Your Values</h3>
			<div class="sitedesc">
				<p>April 27, 2014</p>
				<div>
					<p><em>Exercise 1: When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</em> <br>Some of the values that comes to mind are the following:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Accomplishment</li>
						<li>Accountability</li>
						<li>Challenge</li>
						<li>Compassion</li>
						<li>Economic Security</li>
						<li>Efficiency</li>
						<li>Fairness</li>
						<li>Friendships</li>
						<li>Family</li>
						<li>Helping Others</li>
						<li>Integrity</li>
						<li>Meaningful Work</li>
						<li>Order</li>
						<li>Personal Development</li>
						<li>Recognition</li>
						<li>Romance</li>
						<li>Self Reliance</li>
						<li>Self Respect</li>
						<li>Will Power</li>
						<li>Wisdom</li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>Exercise 2: Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</em><br>
						Helping others is a value that is very important to me. The last job I've had involves helping others in finding the right computer products that gives the person the best value for performance.   I have always been the go to person for my friends when it came to setting up computer networks, building computer systems, and calibration of electronic devices such as HDTV, projectors, and AV systems.   Also my coworkers relied on me to help them build automated solutions to process large amounts of testing data into the companies database.   Lastly I enjoy helping my family in fixing things around the house and keeping our vehicles running in tip top shape.
						</p>
						<p><em>Exercise 3: Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:<br>

						In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>

						Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree </em><br>
						Living up to these values I give myself a 4.   It's not always easy have work that is meaningful, to keep order in my household with 2 kids, to find time for personal development, to check up with my friends, and keep the romance going strong with my wife.   There is always room for improvement.
					</p>
					<p><em>Exercise 4: What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</em><br>
						Last topic that someone asked my advice on was how to setup a network attached storage (NAS) box with redundant mirroring so they can save important documents, share videos and pictures, and play music through the network. </p>
