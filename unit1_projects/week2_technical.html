					<h3>Week 2 Technical Blog - CSS Positioning</h3>
					<img class="imgwrap" src="images/csspos.png"/ width="25%" height="25%">
					<p>So this week I would like to talk about CSS absolute, relative, and fixed positioning.  I figured that since this was the toughest technique I had to learn, describing it would be the best learning tool.
					</p><hr><br>
					<ol>Positioning is broken up into 4 parts
						<li><p>Static - The default position (Will rarely need to use since its default).  This is where the element normally positions itself based on the flow of the other elements on the page.</p><br></li>
						<li><p>Relative - This position starts off in the same position as the default(static) position and can use top, right, left or bottom to move the element. If you do not specify any positioning attributes, it will look just like a static positioned element.   If you put in a positioning attribute such as <span class="css">bottom: 10px;</span>, it will shift the position of the element you are working on up 10px.</p><br></li>
						<li><p>Absolute - This position can use top, right, left, or bottom to place the element anywhere on the screen.   The start location of the element is the tricky part.  The element will start next to a parent element if one of them we're declared as absolute or relative. If there are no parent elements declared as absolute or relative, it will move all the way up to the &lt;HTML&gt; element and position itself to the page. After it moves to its' starting position, it will move to its new location based on the top, right, left, and bottom attributes you entered.</p><br></li>
						<li><p>Fixed - This type of positioning will lock your element in place on a spot on the screen.   Even if you scroll, the position will stay fixed and not flow with the document.  I personally think of this position as the "I dont care" positioning since using fixed will place it where you want but also stay on top of other elements blocking them from view. You have to be careful using this.</p><br>
					</ol>
						<h3>Lets try some examples:</h3>
						<p>Start with the base HTML & CSS code</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposbase.png"/></p>
						<p>What it looks like on the browser</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposbasebr.png"/></p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
						<p>Lets move the red box to the left by 100px relative to the blue box.  Add <span class="css">position: relative; & right: 100px;</span> to #redbox. </p>
						<p>Code Changes</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlrel100.png"/></p>
						<p>What it looks like on the browser. The red box is now moved over to the left by 100px relative to the blue box.</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlrel100br.png"/></p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
						<p>Lets move the red box to right by 100px of the blue box. Add <span class="css">position: absolute; & left:100px;</span> to #redbox to move it over to the right 100px.</p>
						<p>Code Changes</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposabserr.png"/></p>
						<p>Hey wait a sec!  Why did it not move to the right by 100px so it sits next to the blue box?. By not declaring blue box as a relative or absolute position, the red box is moving right 100px from the edge of page not from the blue box.  </p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposabserrbr.png"/></p>
						<p>We need to make sure that the parent element is either absolute or relative positioned. Add <span class="css">position: relative;</span> to #bluebox.</p>
						<p>Code Changes</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposabsrt.png"/></p>
						<p>Now it looks the way we want it</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposabsrtbr.png"/></p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Fixed Positioning</h3>
						<p>Lets force our red box to the upper left hand corner ignoring all other elements.  Add <span class="css">position: fixed; & top: 0; & left: 0;</span> to #redbox.  This will start the redbox at the very top and very left of the page. I also added a &lt;p&gt; paragraph and put a sentence in there to show how the fixed positioning can overshadow elements. </p>
						<p>Code Changes</p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposfix.png"/></p>
						<p>How it looks on the browser.  The red box is now shoved to the upper left hand corner of the page, locked in that position.  Notice that my sentence was covered up by the red box. If you had more content, you'll see the content go underneath the red box as you scrolled up and down. </p>
						<p><img src="images/htmlposfixbr.png"/></p>
						<hr>
						<p>Positioning your elements is great for lining up your content based on the wireframe you created.   As long as you're careful about which container you are positioning, and what position type is in the parents.</p><br>
