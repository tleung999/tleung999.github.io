					<p>I wanted to spend some time today to talk a little about my three favorite sites. Though I'm not 100% positive, I also think one of these sites might be your favorite too.  My main objective is to go over why its my favorite, the page design, layout, visual appeal, and whether the site is meeting the expectation of what it intends to deliver to the end user.</p><hr>
					<h4> SFGate.com</h4>
					<p>This site has a love hate relationship with many of the readers.  Some users love complaining about any updates the site puts forth, such as a new comment system they impleted a year ago, to changing their navigation bar.  I like using it since its my one stop shop to get the daily world and local news.  Many other sites such as Yahoo news or MSN has to cover the whole country so the news is more general and not specific to the San Francisco Bay Area. It's a little challenging at first if you never been to the site, but once you figure out how its all structured, its very straight forward to navigate.</p>

					<p><em>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage?</em><br>
					The area of the site that my eye is looking at immediately when I enter the page is the 3 "top" articles.   This is basically their main carousel that they use to swap in and out hot stories.  There is also sometimes a red banner above the 3 top stories which is their super important message box.   I have seen amber alerts, local sport team scores, and emergency broadcast messages.   The designer definitely wanted to get your attention to that area.
					</p>
					<p><em>How would you describe the website visually?</em><br>
						Visually this site is structured, wordy, bright, overwhelming, useful.
					</p>
					<p><em>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</em><br>
						This sites main focus is to provide up to date news coverage to the San Francisco Bay Area.    Its content is a wide range of news stories, locally, nationally, international.   It also provides the weekly weather forcast and special blogs about local places such as restaurants, bar, and upcoming events.
					</p>
					<p><em>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site?</em><br>
					Serious, Entertaining, Informational, Customizable, Lacking (Some stories are poorly written)
					</p>
					<p><em>How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</em><br>
					It seems to complement the website visual adjectives.
					</p>
					<p><em>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</em><br>Navigation is pretty easy.   You just need to know that the hot stories are up top, then as you scroll down or use the navigation menu, you can drill down to more specific categories such as "Bay Area", "Travel", "Sports", etc.
					</p>
					<p><em>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</em><br>
					The main homepage is very good at finding news stories. Its organized from top to bottom from most important to least.   The individual pages for each navigation menu categories is messy.  For example, if you click on Sport.   The sports page should give you links on the page to find a specific sport not just on the navigation bar.  I recalled my wife having the hardest time trying to news on Wimbledon.
					</p>
					<p><em>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</em><br>
					I'm usually on the main home page, I get all the news I need for the day and move on.   So after being on the site for a while, I feel pretty informed and can skip watching the news on TV.  If I stay on the site longer than that, I'll get pretty bored.
					</p>
					<p><em>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</em><br>
					The site sells subscription to the SFChronicle.com.   The subscription gives you the sunday newspaper and all digital access via tablet, and web for around $12 a month.  I have found no need to subscribe to the SF Chronicle.  I feel I have plenty of information to absorb in one day and I rather spend my time learning something new instead of reading hours worth of news stories.    
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>Craigslist.org</h4>
					<p>This web site as simple as it looks has been a god send to me.   I have always been the type of person that rarely buys things new unless there is no other way to get it or if the item is so cheap it not worth haggling over price.   I have used Craigslist to sell over 10 vehicles from my cars, motorcycles, scooters.  Other than my current car a Subaru Outback, I have only bought my cars used from private parties.   I have also sold unwanted electronics and bought my Macbook Air through this site. Some other useful thing about this site is housing, job seeking, services, and for the adventurous type...the personals section.  This is by far my most favorite site</p>
					<p><em>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage?</em><br>
					The area of the site that my eye is looking at immediately when I enter the page is middle of the page where they list the individual categories in boxes.  You're on this site to buy and sell things, so there is no better place to start looking than at the categories available. 
					</p>
					<p><em>How would you describe the website visually?</em><br>
						Visually this site is structured, plain, simple, useful, unsexy.   
					</p>
					<p><em>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</em><br>
						This sites main focus is to provide a simple and easy interface to quickly buy and sell your stuff.  The content is mainly classified ads, but it also has an event section.
					</p>
					<p><em>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site?</em><br>
					Straight forward, hasslefree, basic, helpful, clean.
					</p>
					<p><em>How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</em><br>
					They are almost indentical in description.  
					</p>
					<p><em>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</em><br>Nothing is easier than clicking on the category or subcategory you're looking for, typing in what you want to search for, and getting your results in a simple and clean list.  I never need to click on page after page to find what I need.   
					</p>
					<p><em>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</em><br>
					The homepage is basically the site map to all your content.   You dont need to go into another page to find what youre looking for.    Everything is available on the homepage itself.  You can search for an item from the whole site or filter down and search within a category.</p>
					<p><em>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</em><br>
					There's nothing really exciting about this site, nothing flashy, nothing fun....well maybe the casual connection section is fun to read sometimes.   But once I run my search, I would usually leave and come back the following day to check again.</p>
					<p><em>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</em><br>
					The site doesn't sell anything to individuals, but I know they do sell job posting subscriptions to companies to allow them to post jobs on their site.  But I have no idea about pricing. </p>
					<hr>
					<h4>iFixit.com</h4>
					<p>This site is one of my favorite site to use to find documenation on how to safely fix some of my electronic devices.  Electronics, especially Apple products has hidden screws, latches, and lever that you need to push or pull, else you might break your device if you try to pry or force your way in.  The tools they have are pretty comprehensive and works well in helping you disassemble many computer parts or mobile devices.</p>
					<p><em>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage?</em><br>
					The area of the site that my eye is looking at immediately when I enter the page is the two links to find a repair guide or shop for tools.
					</p>
					<p><em>How would you describe the website visually?</em><br>
						Visually this site is modern, simple, clean, organized, useful.
					</p>
					<p><em>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</em><br>
						This sites main focus is to provide instructional guide on how to repair a device.   From appliances, phones, laptops, desktops, and game consoles.  It also provides a shopping area for you to buy tools and replacement parts.
					</p>
					<p><em>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site?</em><br>
					useful, helpful, comprehensive, simple, easy.
					</p>
					<p><em>How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</em><br>
					They are almost indentical in description.  
					</p>
					<p><em>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</em><br>The homepage was just a simple landing pad for a more involved site.   Once you click on Repair Guides for example, you will be taken to another page that categorizes different types of repair jobs.   You can click on a repair job type such as Mac Repair and it will give you another set of subcategories to pick and you will continue to tree downward from there to the family device name, down to the year the device was made, and then to the individual component you want to repair.    
					</p>
					<p><em>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</em><br>
					It was very easy to browser and find what you need.   If you gone too deep into the device you can back out and pick another part of the device you want to repair.
					</p>
					<p><em>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</em><br>
					I feel excited simply because of the fact that I save myself a load of cash from having to pay someone to do a simple repair that took maybe 30 mins.   </p>
					<p><em>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</em><br>
					The site sells all types of tools as well as the replacement parts for the devices.   I have bought a repair tool kit from them before.   Their tool kit includes specialize bits (T5 Star bit) that only work on Apple products. </p>
