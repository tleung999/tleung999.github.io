					<h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>

							<li><h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
								<p>When it comes to emotional conflict, I feel there is a big difference between the conflict you
									have at home with your spouse vs the one you have in a working environment.    Conflicts at home
									are usually more heated and open since you know each other well and there isn't anyone around to 
									truly judge your behavior.   While work conflicts you have to keep a manner of professionalism 
									and not easily loose your cool.   Since you the reader are not my spouse, I shall spend my time today
									talking about my work place conflict.   
								</p><br>
								<p>
									One emotional conflict I recalled which was about 6 years ago, was stirred up over a conversation I had with my coworker who was the programmer in the lab I worked.   We started off talking about programming and how I thought up of a grand plan to use Visual Basic for Applications in Microsoft Excel to automate our test result processing and simultanously generate visual graphic charts within Excel to pass to the editors.  Being a programmer of many years, my coworker felt that VBA was a joke and that C and C++ was the "real" programmer language.  I felt that simply using Excel VBA was a good solution since everyone in the company has MS Office installed and Excel is something they we're comfortable with.   
								</p><br>
							</li>
							<li><h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
								<p>
									I believe the source of the conflict really stems from him wanting to feel superior and impose his opinion on me.   
								</p><br>
							</li>
							<li><h4>How did you handle that conflict?</h4>
									<p>
										Well since he was older than I was and since he had over 20 years of programming experience, I really didn't want to argue or fight it out with him.  I basically said my few sentences of what I wanted to do and didn't really respond to his belittling of my ideas.   
									</p><br>
							</li>		
							<li><h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>
								<p>My actions really did nothing to make it better.   It actually reinforced his bad behavior and we would talk about other subjects where he would end up shooting down my ideas again.  
								</p><br>
							</li>
							<li><h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
								<p>
									If I could go back and had more courage in confronting the problem, I would try to talk it out with him and find out the root cause of why he always needed to feel superior to everyone.   I would also admit that my idea might not be right, and to encourage him to give input to the solution.  
								</p><br>
							</li>
							<li><h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
								<p>
									Reading about the Compass of Shame I felt that I started to enter a state of "Withdrawal", where I was isolating myself and hiding because I felt that I was not as knowledgable as he was and he might make others percieve me as not being as smart as he is.  I learned that its OK not to know everything, and admit to not knowing about a subject.   But don't be afraid to say how you feel and confront others if they shoot you down.
