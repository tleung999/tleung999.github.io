					<h4>What's your take on the DBC experience?</h4>
					<p>Listening to Shereef's Fireside chat was a real eye opening experience.  Its great to hear his description of the students being chefs in a kitchen working together no matter the experience level, rather than students being a patron sitting at the table ordering courses.  I apologize but during Shereef's video, I kept envisioning 20+ swedish chefs, throwing pots, pans, and chickens all over the kitchen. </p>  <br>
					<h4>What is your impression of DBC?</h4>
					I am really impressed with DBC and its method of teaching you how to learn instead of just learning a language and thats it.  I was also quite impressed with the level of prep we are required to work on before even going into the program.  When Shereef said that he wanted us to jam with him instead of just learning scales, that really helped me to understand why there is so much work in prep.  We want to spend our time creating great things instead of spending all our time learning the basics.     
					</p><br>
					<h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
					<p>DBC is a place where we can feel comfortable being vulnerable and it is OK not to know something.  I was always that student that sat in the back of class afraid to ask questions because I didnt want anyone to think I didn't know what I was doing, or that they might judge me for asking a stupid question.  I am looking forward to being in an environment where I can openly discuss my ideas, ask for help if I dont understand something, and feel like we are all part of a huge team that will pick each other up</p><br>
					<h4>Have your expectations of DBC changed?</h4>
					<p>
						Having visited some other bootcamps, my expectations of DBC hasn't really changed.  They will all teach you how to code and become a good entry level web developer, but DBC won me over simply because they really push engineering empathy, pair programming, and a strong team building environment.   I know the program will be intense and require a lot from me, but I am looking forward to giving it my all.
					</p><br>
					<h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
					<p>I am quite nervous about if I can handle the load when the program starts.   But I believe this will be an exciting time in my life and this will tremendously help direct my career in the path that I always want to go.  </p>
