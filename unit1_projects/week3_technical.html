					<h3>Week 3 Technical Blog - Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h3>
					<img class="imgwrap" src="images/javascript_logo.png" width="25%" height="25%"/>
					<p>Javascript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich when he was a developer at Netscape. It was designed to be loosely typed, meaning you did not have to explicitly declare a variable to be a decimal number (float), or a string of letters (string).    It was aimed at
					allowing people with tie in web page elements without a need for a compiler and without knowledge of object oriented software design. But since it wasnt complied code, it wasn't taken seriously by traditional programmers and seen as a toy. 
					</p><br>
					<p>Javascript started off doing simple visual tasks from manipulating images, mouse over effects, and form based dynamic content.  As it progressed to handle more content types, from running asynchronous scripts using AJAX to handling back end database calls using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, Javascript is becoming the go to language to do it all quickly and easily.  Also with the mobile world of tablets and phones starting to take over how we consume our content, Apple and Google has allowed developers to build hybrid applications using Javascipt instead of using Objective C and Java (There's also third party wrappers such as PhoneGap).   Next the number of Javascript libraries is vast and continuing to grow more everyday.   Some popular libraries such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for DOM manipulation and graphical user interface tools such as <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> help to simplify building dynamically rich content.  Lastly the number of available frameworks such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> all help to turn your web page into a web application.   </p><br>
					<p>With constant contribution from the development community, the ease of use to quickly start coding, and easy transition from working on the front end building web content to using Node.js to work on the back end data, Javascript will likely continue to dominate our web development landscape for a long time.
