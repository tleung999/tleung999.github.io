###Pairing

For the last 8 weeks, I've been pairing with members of my cohort twice a week to solve challenges and code together. For those of you not familiar with pair programming, two people work together to solve coding problems, sharing one screen, and takes turns being a driver and navigator.  The role of a driver is usually the person that would do the typing of code while the navigator is the person looking at the problem at a higher level view.   The navigator spends their time outlining the problem, keeping the code in sync with the pseudocode, and think ahead about how to solve the next step of the problem.   

My experience pairing has been fun and challenging.   Whenever we begin a session, I feel like I am on my toes the whole time we are working.   Last thing I would want to do is let my pair down and not contribute enough into the exercise.   So I am constantly thinking about the next step in code and looking online for help if necessary.   

Some of things that was rewarding was getting comfortable working with people of different personality and skill levels.   There are times, I felt like the student while other times I am the teacher.   

Some of the more frustating aspects are when your pair talks over you or doesn't give you a chance to give your input about solving a problem.   Another problem is that some of our pairing sessions are only an hour long, so since we are not allowed to look at the challenge ahead of time, we end up scrambling to find the answer and try to allow enough time for each one of us to take a turn driving and navigating.

###Feedback

For every pairing session we have with another member at DBC, we are required to also provide feedback on our experience.  Our feedback needs to be kind, actionable, and specific.   During our first few weeks in our Prep phase, reading feedback was sometimes harsh, too vague, and didn't have concrete steps to improve things.  But as we got used to providing feedback, I felt that everyone learned to provide very helpful feedback on things we can improve on, such as give your pair a chance to voice their opinion, define the driving and navigating roles clearly, dont be afraid to use Google to look for help, and take your time to figure out your pseudocode before jumping into coding.  We also learned how to give more specific feedback where we give full details on a specific problem such as solving a challenge by using the Ruby enumerable method map! to reassign values within an array.   

I feel that all the feedback I received has been very helpful in making sure I am mindful of others, I am constantly thinking out loud and explaining my thought process, and giving my pair a chance to provide their solution.  Based on some of the feedbacks I received, I will definitely try my best to layout the groundwork beforehand before diving into code.  One of the most difficult task now when writing feedback is what type of actionable item I can think of for my pair to improve on.  After 8 weeks of pairing, I feel that many of us has gotten pretty used to pairing and know how to work together.    Everyone in the cohort seems to understand the DBC mentality and know that this is safe environment for everyone to work in, express their opinion openly, and not get laughed at for providing bad solutions to problems.   

Overall, I really enjoy pairing and working with others in solving problems.   You're not a one man/woman army, and we learn so much from each other when we pair.   I got a chance to show one of my pairs how to use shortcuts in Sublime, and others have shown me how to use some methods in Ruby that I never known about.   Plus I also feel that when one person gets stuck and locked in their solution, the other pair can help look at the problem in a different angle and help move the solution along.
