Before starting the Phase 0 of DBC, I took a personal thinking style quiz that determined that my [Gregorc Thinking Style](http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm) was Concrete Sequential.  Turns out that I crave things to be in an orderly sequence and I work best in a structured environment.   

Some of the struggles I had during Phase 0 was trying to lay out the groundwork on exactly what steps to take and how my pseudocode should be planned out.   Once I figured out the pseudcode, I didnt have too much problem figuring out how to piece all the parts together to complete the code.   I also felt that if some of the challenges such as the fibonacci sequence or the binary search did not provide me a sample of what the algorithm should look like I would be stuck.   I feel that in order to help balance my thinking process, I should take more chances to experiment, take the time to listen to others suggestions or solutions, and think outside the box.     

I think that one hurdle I need to overcome is be willing to take some risk and try experimenting more.    I've always had a fear of doing things wrong and at times just end up not working on something due to that fear.   I feel just throughout Phase 0, I have started to become more comfortable taking unknown challenges head on and trying my best to solve things even though I might have been going down the wrong path.   I've also started to become more mindful of my emotions when working on problems that might be frustrating, to take breaks, and reach out to others for help.   

I am looking forward to starting the next step in my life and entering Phase 1 of DBC.
