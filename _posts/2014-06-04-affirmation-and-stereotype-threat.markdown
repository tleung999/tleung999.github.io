On the first week of entering the prep phase of Dev Bootcamp I was given an assignment to write a blog about the types of values that are important to me.   After my last blog on stereotype threats, I now think back on whether some of these values can help mediate these stereotypes. A few values I felt that really stands out on negating stereotypes threats are will power and personal development.  Having the will power to face problems head on can help you alleviate the threats quickly before it overwhelms you.   The last thing I would want is these stereotype threats to fester and eat me up inside.   The next value personal development is really an outcome of will power. 

Personal development is gained through repetition, practice, and discovering myself.   I think of it like writing code, the more you practice and learn, the more comfortable you'll get.  Breaking through the stereotype threats is something I can't develop overnight. It'll take lots of practice to recognize the threats and become comfortable dealing with the threat. 

As I continue to have the will power to fight through the stereotypes, I will become much more capable of handling these self doubts and my personal development will continue to grow.
