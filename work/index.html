        </h3>
        <p>I built this web application to see pricing trends for items in Guild Wars 2.  When you click on an individual item, it will pull up a dashboard showing the item details, chart of historical prices, buyers vs sellers chart, and profit margin. </p>
        <p>This web application was built using a Rails API backend serving JSON though REST endpoints. The Rails server runs off a <a href="http://beagleboard.org/black">Beaglebone Black</a> using a PostgreSQL database. The front end was built using AngularJS hosted on an EC2 instance on AWS. </p>

        <h3><a href="http://rubegoldberg.herokuapp.com/">What time is it? A Rubegoldberg Machine</a>
        </h3>
        <p>This project was trying to emulate a rubegoldberg machine, or series of random complex events to do something simple such as telling the time. We used a sinatra framework and had a master controller that plugged in JavaScript modules after a certain amount of time. The website also connected to a Wemo to bring the rubegoldberg website into reality so you might not get the whole effect.</p>

        <p>So I was tasked to create a game in Javascript using objects and integrating it with visuals using HTML and CSS. Using Code Combat as an example, here's what I came up with.</p>
